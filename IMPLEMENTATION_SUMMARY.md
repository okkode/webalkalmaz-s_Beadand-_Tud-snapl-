# Implementation Summary: Notes and Monthly AI Summaries Feature

## Overview
This implementation adds a comprehensive note-taking system with AI-powered monthly summaries for students. The feature allows students to create notes for courses, and automatically generates monthly summaries using OpenAI's ChatGPT API.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Note-Taking System**
- ✅ Students can create notes for each course
- ✅ Notes support both plain text and rich text (HTML) content
- ✅ Notes are stored per-user and per-course
- ✅ Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- ✅ Notes are displayed in the course view dialog
- ✅ Modern UI with MudBlazor components

### 2. **Voice-to-Text Functionality**
- ✅ Voice recording using browser's MediaRecorder API
- ✅ Automatic transcription using OpenAI Whisper API
- ✅ Voice input can be added to notes
- ✅ Integrated into the note-taking dialog

### 3. **Monthly AI Summaries**
- ✅ Automatic generation of monthly summaries from notes
- ✅ Background service runs on the 1st of each month at 2 AM
- ✅ AI generates three sections:
  - **Summary**: Detailed overview of learned material
  - **What did you learn this month?**: Personal learning insights
  - **What do the students present?**: Presentation summaries
- ✅ Summaries are stored per-user, per-month
- ✅ Beautiful UI page to view all monthly summaries

### 4. **Database Schema**
- ✅ `A_NOTE` table for storing notes
- ✅ `A_MONTHLY_SUMMARY` table for storing AI-generated summaries
- ✅ Proper foreign key relationships with cascade delete
- ✅ Indexes for performance optimization

## Background Service

The `HostedService` includes a monthly summary generation job that:
- Runs on the 1st of each month at 2 AM
- Collects all notes from the previous month for each active user
- Generates AI summaries using OpenAI GPT-4o
- Parses and structures the AI response
- Saves summaries to the database

## Voice-to-Text Integration

The voice-to-text feature:
- Uses browser's MediaRecorder API for recording
- Sends audio to `/api/audio/stt` endpoint
- Uses OpenAI Whisper for transcription
- Automatically inserts transcribed text into notes
- Provides visual feedback during recording

## Next Steps

1. **Run the database migration** (see MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
2. **Test the note-taking functionality** in a course view
3. **Test voice recording** (requires microphone permissions)
4. **Wait for or manually trigger** monthly summary generation
5. **View summaries** at `/summaries` route

## Configuration

Make sure your `appsettings.json` includes:
```json
{
  "OpenAI": {
    "ApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
  },
  "apiUrl": "http://localhost:5000"
}
```

## Notes

- The monthly summary generation runs automatically, but you can test it manually by adjusting the date check in `HostedService.cs`
- Voice recording requires HTTPS in production (browser security requirement)
- The AI summary prompt is designed for Hungarian language, but can be easily adapted
- All user data is properly isolated (users can only see their own notes and summaries)
